Retail Zone Assignment Program - High-Level Overview

1. Purpose:
   This program automates the assignment of retail employees to specific zones based on their skills and schedules.

2. Key Components:
   a. Employee Class: Represents individual employees with their names, skills, and schedules.
   b. Zone Class: Represents store zones, each requiring a specific skill and tracking assignments.
   c. Schedule Reader: Imports employee schedules from a CSV file.
   d. Zone Assignment Engine: Assigns employees to zones based on skills and availability.
   e. Output Generator: Produces a readable format of zone assignments.

3. Main Functionality:
   - Reads employee schedules and skills from a CSV file.
   - Assigns one employee per zone at any given time.
   - Ensures continuous coverage of zones when possible.
   - Minimizes employee rotations between zones.
   - Assigns based on current needs and employee skills.

4. Process Flow:
   a. Load employee data from CSV file.
   b. Initialize zone objects for each store area.
   c. Sort employees by shift start time.
   d. Iterate through employees and time slots, assigning to available zones.
   e. Generate and display zone assignments.

5. Current Limitations:
   - Does not handle breaks or lunches (planned for future implementation).
   - No standby list for extra employees (planned for future implementation).
   - Does not consider peak hours or multi-employee zone staffing.

6. Future Enhancements:
   - Implement break and lunch scheduling.
   - Add a standby list for unassigned employees.
   - Create a user interface for easier data input and visualization.
   - Implement more sophisticated assignment algorithms for complex scenarios.

7. Input Format:
   CSV file with columns: Name, Skills, Start Time, End Time

8. Output Format:
   Text-based list of assignments for each zone, sorted by time.

This program provides a foundation for automating zone assignments in a retail environment, with room for future expansions and refinements based on specific store needs.
